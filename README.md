# Orbitals
A program to display simple orbits within a system that you can generate.

## How to use
Simply click anywhere to generate a planet and that planet will begin its orbit around the sun.

## TODO's
- Calculate the orbits and move them accordingly
- Allow for user customization of the planet that they spawn and the sun
  - Allow for changing the mass, size, initial velocity
  - Create a slider for a simple way to change these numbers
- Set up sprite sheet, so the planet picture that is generated each time is random
 - Clean up sprite sheet transparent background
 - Decide on final size of planets
- Figure out how to scale the planets when zooming in or out
- Clean up planet spawning so they can't generate on top of each other
