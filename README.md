# Orbitals
A program to display simple orbits within a system that you can generate.

## How to use
Simply click anywhere to generate a planet and that planet will begin its orbit around the sun.

## TODO's
- Calculate the orbits and move them accordingly
- Allow for user customization of the planet that they spawn
  - Also allow for customization of the sun
- Set up sprite sheet, so the planet picture that is generated each time is random
